        <h3>Welcome to the text based version of the See 'N' Say StoryMaker book!</h3>
        <h4>YOU have been selected to try out our first text-based version for <em>FREE</em>.</h4>
        <p>Physical story maker books used to be popular... until they started to go off on their own in the middle of the night; this creeped everyone out. To save the fun activies of this book, we've moved to a text based version. Here you can have the same selections as the physical book, without the truamatic experiences of the real book.</p>
        <p>Please be sure to give our product a review in the future. Happy Story making!</p>

        the desired result or not. So instead I'll start out with just an array for each section and figure it out as I go */
